## The very good, incredibly awesome `libdummy`


This project is a dummy `c++` library designed
to roughly emulate the FFI contract exposed by a proprietary library in the form of a `.so`.
It's easier to iterate ideas on my personal machine hence, `libdummy` was born.


### Note
just in case it was missed in [README.md](../README.md), this is a crude attempt at `c++` from
a `java` developer which, I'm guessing will be evident by looking at the code :satisfied:
